# ML-Algorithms-Tkinter-Simulator
##Description
This code simulates 6 famous machine learning algorithms in a user friendly manner.
The algorithms are applied on a data file, which is littoralis data. This data was collected by Precision Agriculture engineers directly from a field. The data collection process was inaccurate, and thus the high error and low accuracy results.
The code is written in Python3, using Tkinter library to simulate a Graphical User Interface. The GUI allows the user to pick their desired algorithm. Once chosen, the algorithm is applied on the data file, and result are shown.
